3. weird question ? do we classify between these different bulky elements ? (no baseline needed)

or do we compare performance of the bulky elements (baseline needed)

4.  is this question about classifying AA66266AA
or AA662266AA ? 
Since we're testing sensitivity of the method, should we use the method as the one we're using to read/classify bit strings ?

5. is this question about classfiying between AA00400AA and AA66466AA ?

6. Comparing accuracies between different polymer structures
